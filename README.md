### Vue 3


[Demo](https://mycurelabs.github.io/vue-html-to-paper/)

[GitBook Documentation](https://oss.mycure.md/v/vue-html-to-paper/)

### Vue 2

Vue 2 is now low priority support, but feel free to send PR to [v1](https://github.com/mycurelabs/vue-html-to-paper/tree/v1) branch, and I'll be happy to publish them.

There are no changes to the way you use the plugin nor the way you install it. You can still refer to the latest documentation.

Version for Vue 2 - [v1.4.5](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vue-html-to-paper/v/1.4.5)
